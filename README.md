# fuck censorship

Another NaNoGenMo 2016 entry.

Anne Haight's "Banned Books 387 B.C. To 1978 A.D." gives a history of
book-banning through the ages. Many of the banned books that Anne Haight
discusses are available from Project Gutenberg.

My code censors them.

```

```

I will create a separate repo for all the censored works.

# Usage

- `git clone https://github.com/booyaa/fuckcensorship`
- cd fuckcensorship
- Place books (text format) to be censored in the folder called `IN`.
- `./fuckcensorship.sh`
- Your censored material will be in the folder clled `OUT`.

To follow...
