# fuck censorship

Another NaNoGenMo 2016 entry.

Anne Haight's "Banned Books 387 B.C. To 1978 A.D." gives a history of
book-banning through the ages. Many of the banned books that Anne Haight

My code censors them.

emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set
aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must
be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour
and anxiety to acquire.
